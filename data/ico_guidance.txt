We are currently experiencing problems with guidance downloads, which means that you may not be able to access the PDF of this guidance using the "download options" button.
You can access a PDF version of this guidance at this link

This guidance discusses the right of access in detail. Read it if you have detailed questions not answered in the Guide, or if you need a deeper understanding to help you apply the right of access in practice. It is aimed at data protection officers (DPOs) and those with specific data protection responsibilities in larger organisations.
Guidance tailored towards small organisations
can be found in our data protection advice for small organisations. This guidance does not specifically cover the right of access under Parts 3 and 4 of the Data Protection Act 2018. However, some of the guidance contains practical examples and advice which will still be relevant.
If you haven’t yet read the ‘in brief’ page on the
right of access
in the Guide to Data Protection, you should read that first. It introduces this topic and sets out the key points you need to know, along with practical checklists to help you comply.
